# Witcher-relationship-Extraction
In this project first using selenuium, I get names of characters in witcher books from witcher wiki
Then using spacy and networkx I make a relationship between each characters after doing some data cleaning.
Using networkx got a interactive visualisation of the witcher network.
This project is a learning project for me and my main sources were youtube channel: The VU data analytics Github link for her repo of this same project: https://github.com/thu-vu92/the_witcher_network
Books for witcher were taken from github repo: https://github.com/dworschak/Witcher
